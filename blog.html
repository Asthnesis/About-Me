        <div class="journey">
                My journey began in mid December 2019 when I learnt a bit of HTML. I took short notes in a book but I didn't pay much thought to. I was just doing it for fun and when I was in school I just read the notes in my free time and that was just it. I didn't know something had been ignited in me and since that day, a year later I began diving into this world. Currently I am learning Python, JavScript, HTML/CSS and also SQL database. I hope in the future I will be able to write complex programs in these and many more languages. I have to keep on pushing and continue doing new things everyday

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">My Passion</h1>
        <div class="container-b">
            <div class="passion">
            I like to code most of the times coding but I also love learning new stuff not only in coding but other things. I am currently learning Russian. I love the language as it is challenging to learn and it just helps me view things in another way.
            What I love about programming is that it makes you make your dream a reality. like literally. It is amazing how an idea, any idea can be transformed to an app  or a website or a beautiful design with use of words.
           My future journey and what I dream of achieving motivates me to continue with the leap and learning more and getting to know more to share and connect with others who have the same passion. What drives me is my passion and the feeling of never being comfortable just knowing enough. With coding, it is always learning new things everyday and thinking about things in a different, beautiful way.
